# How Cuvva dirupted the UK's car insurance industry? Or did they?
Written by: Douglas Tait

## Overview and Origin
**What is the name of the company?**
Cuvva is an insurtech with a headquarters in Central London, United Kingdom. 

**When was the company incorporated?**
Cuvva was incorporated in October 2015 in Scotland. 

**Who are the founders of the company?**
Freddy Macnamara is the company founder. 

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
Macnamara founded the company after he became frustrated with the time wasted and complexities with changing car insurance when he shared his car. He had already established 3 companies prior to starting Cuvva. As a serial entrepreneur, Macnamara wanted to establish a digital/techonologist company and he decided that it was an excellent focus area. 

Prior to building a team or raising funding, Macnamara decided that it was pertinent to identify a car insurance company that would support this business concept. During his initial research, he had spoken to a lot of this car insurance executives and he returned with a product map with how he thought the solution would work. 

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

Macnamara invested all his own and his business savings to start the process. Prior to receiving an investor. 

Summary of Cuvva initial funding and amount received: 

* 2015: US$140,000 (funded from friends, family and angels. Initial round of funding totalled).
* 2016: US$555,687 (raised this additional amount by early 2016).
2017: US$1,852,198 (new funding in a round led by venture capital fund LocalGlobe, followed by several investors including Tekton Ventures, Techstars Ventures, Seedcamp, Nick Hugerford and Ian Hogarth).
* 2019: US$18 million (Series A)
* 2022: Cuvva will be executing a raise via Seedrs (crowdfunding platform). The raised will be used for growth activities across engineering, product and marketing. 

Interesting takeaway for Cuvva was that it took 12-months a year to get an underwriter to underwrite the product. During the first 12-months Macnamara quoted that he only spent $700. During this period Macnmara was fortunate to have access to the different insurance companies, because insurtech was at its infancy. According to Macnamara, a lot of the underwriters have shut their door and limited their engagement with start-ups.

## Business Activities
**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
Cuvva was not the first company to launch a pay-as-you-drive scheme in UK or globally. It identified an opportunity in the market to provide a one-off drivers to access a more tailored insurance. This is a unique disruptor to a monopolised sector in the finance industry. Cuvva’s goal was to provide accessibility to specific products for car ‘borrowers. This may seem very strange to different demographics or even culture. The uniqueness of this problem is that it is based on a behaviour of tomorrow, which has led to its adoption. 

During its inception in 2015, the car insurance market throughout the globe was driven by a one-shoe-fits all policy for premium. It focussed less on the customer, but more on the bottom line. In an interview Macnamara indicated that the industry was analysing data, but to drive the bottom-line rather than develop a solution to meet the customer’s requirement. The price comparative market platform took the customer interactions away from the companies and more on price elasticity. 

Since 2015, Cuvva has continued to evolve to stay relevant in the industry and is looking at new innovative ways to reduce the risks to the underwriters through the adoption of new technology. Cuvva may have lost its bearing in relation to its problem, but the product has continued to disrupt the industry. Macnamara alluded to in an interview that the demand side was easy to manage, but the supplier side was filled with complexities. This type of commentary supports the step-change required for Cuvva. 

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Cuvva customer target is based in the UK and is part of a very specific demographic. It seems that the initial focus point in the market was on millennials that were open to borrowing or lending their vehicles. This is very relevant to his initial experience in 2015. While Cuvva is still focus on the ‘Borrow Market’, it has definitely transition its focus on the ‘Owner Market’, which will represent a larger industry footprint. 

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)**

At the time of inception Cuvva developed a product that did not exist, which was evident during the first year of the product roadmap. Macnamara product development provides an excellent takeaway for all entrepreneurs in developing a solution and testing the market.

Macnamara spent the first year of Cuvva discussing with senior executives with the car insurance industry on why a product like Cuvva does not exists. It was evident in Macnamara product development that the keystone to this solution was to identify an underwriter that would partner with Cuvva. Two good learnings were identified through this process. First it allowed them to demonstrate their product road map and potential partners in the solution. Secondly and most importantly, it enabled them to define the problem even further in relation to the car insurance ecosystem.  

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)**

Cuvva disrupted the traditional insurance company by developing a platform to sidestep the insurance brokers. The platform enabled the customer to connect to the underwriters via a platform. While its entry into the market initial was via a platform, Cuvva is attempting to use big data, data analytics and machine learning to not only evolve, but futureproof its offering as an insurtech. Without deep diving into the technology and assessing if it meets its claims, the evolution of the product to further reduce the risk to the underwriter is a logical step. 

## Landscape  
**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
Cuvva operates in the car insurance industry. 

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?**
A report developed by Delotte on consumer demand on home and motor insurance products, highlighted the following: 

Customers strongly favoured simplicity and adjustability
Develop demographic centric products that are specific to their needs
Hyper-personalisation of product in a simplified manner (...offering customers the right product simply and at the right time…)
Customers want to avoid sharing more data with insurer than they normally do while buying a basic product. 

Cuvva has been able to develop a product that meet these current problems. But it has taken its product the next level, by orientating new customer to a mobile application to access any quotes. Whether this process was designed to collect available data from the potential customer or more important it enables the initial verification process, it is a very unique customer acquisition process. 

UK Motor Insurance Market Trend Report 2021 estimates that the motor insurance generates a Gross Written Premium (GWP) if just over 14.2 billion in 2019. During an interview in December 2020, it was claimed that Macnamara had penetrated 3% of the motor insurance - in which he claimed that those numbers were a lot higher because it was hard to quantify his customer based.

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**
Cuvva is the only insurtech in the UK for this part of the sector. There are a number of similar type of companies throughout the globe, but the different regulations and structures does not make them a direct competitor in the UK domain. 

A couple of companies that provide similar services external to the UK. 

* Friday: Is a motor and house insurance company based out of Germany. Unlike Cuvva is it not focus 100% on its app with a number of other communication channel.
* noblr: Is a US based insurance company that provides very similar product offering to both Cuvva and Friday. It is an app-centric business. 

# Result
**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
There has been mixed reporting on the overall revenue generation from US$ 21 million to US$78 million. With limited information available, it is hard to assess the overall impact Cuvva has had on the industry.

However, the lack of mature competitors is always an excellent indicator that there may be limitations to the market. 

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
It is hard to assess metrics with limited information made shared by private companies. A good indicator of a company’s growth can be seen through employee engagement. Cuvva has engaged approximately 150 employees, which is approximately a 43% increase from 2021.

The last recorded raise was a Series A in 2019, which provides an excellent metric that Cuvva is generating strong revenue. However, the only red flag that counters this assumption is the fact that Cuvva is undergoing a raise via crowdfunding with Seedrs. The raise may also be a marketing play to generate brand awareness. 

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
While it has disrupted part of the industry through positive media attention. The lack of competitors in the industry highlights that either the demand or supply side may have questionable earning potential. 

# Recommendations
**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

There are elements in the design of Cuvva that can be improved. It operates in a manner that it is personally underwriting the different products. But it is obvious it is operating in the traditional format of brokerage. The technology development is more aligned to a digital business platform that operates in a dual marketplace. This business model is no different to any platform business, where Cuvva is connecting demand and supply side of the industry via the platform. While there is an element of data analytics to reduce the risk to the underwrite, the technology at this stage is limited to big data, data analytics, IoTs and machine learning.

To be more imaginative and disrupt the industry to its core, Cuvva could develop an investing platform to secure funding to underwrite its product. Unfortunately, the market will continue to leverage through the existing balance sheets of the large insurers. Customer engagement to share historical data is key to providing a truly flexible product that is not overpriced. Evidence exists through reports that customers are not willing to share data with insurance companies. There is a perception with insurance companies that may be related to the limited benefits they provide. 

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Based on the 3% claim made in an interview with Macnamara, it is clear that he has only targetted a niche market. Whether the adoption by the different demographic is limited or it is hard to compete with the larger insurers as Cuvva is only brokering an existing product. But if it was possible to self-insure and deliver an extremely competitive price-point in the market, which will open the possibility for a larger market share, but will drive new competitors to the industry. 

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?**
Data analytics and IoTs will be the driving force to generating lower risk scores for new and existing customers. The reduction in premium can only be driven through an accurate assessment of available historical data. To access cheaper insurance, a certain demographic is targeted in the market that complies with a low-risk customer profile.
